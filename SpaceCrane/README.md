SpaceCrane
====================================================
　　SpaceCrane was my second game project while I studied aboard in Copenhagen, Denmark. It required by one of the course, Game Development, as a practical and conceptual introduction to game design and development.<br>

## Supplements<br>
The 'SpaceCrane.zip' file is a Windows build of my game, in a .zip file. You should download the files and unzip it; execute the application with .exe suffix under the Windows operating system.
