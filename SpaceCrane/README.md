SpaceCrane
====================================================
　　SpaceCrane was my first game project while I studied aboard in Copenhagen, Denmark. It required by one of the course, Game Development, as a practical and conceptual introduction to game design and development. This project was significant to me since it was my first time to develop a playable game and the success of this project leaded me to a career of game developer.<br>
