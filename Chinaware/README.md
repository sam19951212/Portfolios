Chinaware
====================================================
　　Chinaware was my first company’s project. It is an online 3D mobile educational game about Chinese Porcelain arts. It contains several modules to help the users to experience and understand the beauty of tradition Chinese Porcelain making. Users can experience the mold process from throwing, coloring, enameling, drawing (customized patterns) to the final firing and share their favorite work with friends. The game presents the process from blank selection to firing in 3D form, allowing the users to experience the complicated and arduous process of porcelain manufacturing. The game also demonstrates the technical differences of varied classic porcelain types and tells the story of porcelain inheritance and development in the vicissitude of dynasties.<br>
　　The project was developed by a development team while I was one of the new programmer. I programmed development requirements purposed by game designers and managers. Specifically, I developed game features, including UI, 3D interaction with scenes, camera movements, muti-language system and manage game components.<br>
　　This project intents to perform as an exploration of serious game, which helps people understand the positive and social values of gaming. The project seeks to promote Chinese culture through human-computer interactions and convey its educational knowledge in a nontraditional way. <br>
　　First thing I learned from the project is professionalism. Worked on a project for a company could be different from the school project since I had to communicate team members with various backgrounds, needs, perspectives and thinking styles. While in school, we could assume that your teammates had similar knowledge in understanding the technical topics. Working in a game development team, however, I need to explain technical terms in plain way to the designer and arts who may not have the technical backgrounds. Besides that, the project management was a lot more intense in a professional development. I had to dealt with deadline pressures and to be efficient when the design or the requirement changes. Adhere to the project’s coding standards was also one of the most important merit while working with the other programmers.
